## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Project Structure
This mod is built for **Minecraft 1.21.1** using **NeoForge 21.1.92** and **Java 21**.

#### Core Components

**Registry Classes:**
- `ModItems.java` - Registers all mod items (seeds, buds, joints)
- `ModBlocks.java` - Registers the weed crop block
- `ModCreativeTabs.java` - Creates the custom creative mode tab

**Block Implementation:**
- `WeedCropBlock.java` - Extends `CropBlock` for cannabis cultivation mechanics
- Supports 8 growth stages with appropriate blockstate definitions
- Integrates with Minecraft's crop growth system

**Item Implementation:**
- `WeedJointItem.java` - Custom consumable item with multiple potion effects
- Uses `UseAnim.TOOT_HORN` for smoking animation
- 32-tick consumption duration (same as food items)

**Resource Structure:**
- `assets/fourtwenty/` - Client-side resources (models, textures, lang files)
- `data/drugcolonies/` - Data-driven content (recipes, loot tables)
- Comprehensive blockstate definitions for all 8 crop growth stages
- Custom item models for seeds, buds, and joints

#### Dependencies
- **Minecraft**: 1.21.1
- **NeoForge**: 21.1.92+
- **Java**: 21 (required)

### Game Integration
The mod seamlessly integrates with vanilla Minecraft mechanics:
- Cannabis crops follow standard farming rules (require farmland, water, light)
- Loot tables ensure balanced drop rates (buds only from mature crops)
- Recipe system uses standard crafting mechanics
- Effect system uses vanilla potion effects for compatibility

## For Users

### Installation & Usage

1. **Requirements**: Ensure you have Minecraft 1.21.1 with NeoForge 21.1.92+ installed
2. **Download**: Get the latest release from CurseForge (link TBD)
3. **Install**: Place the mod JAR file in your `mods/` folder
4. **Play**: Start Minecraft and look for the "Four Twenty" creative tab

### Getting Started
1. **Obtain Seeds**: Find weed seeds in the Four Twenty creative tab or through other means

### Compiling FourTwenty

IMPORTANT: Please report any issues you have, as there might be some problems with the documentation! Also make sure you know EXACTLY what you're doing! It's not our fault if your OS crashes, becomes corrupted, etc.

#### Setup Java
The Java JDK is used to compile FourTwenty.

1. Download and install the Java JDK 21.
    * [Windows](https://adoptopenjdk.net/): Choose OpenJDK 21 (LTS) version and HotSpot JVM, then click the `latest release` button. After the download is complete, open the file, accept the license agreement, and in a custom setup make sure that `Add to Path` and `Set JAVA_HOME` are set to `Entire feature will be installed on your local hard drive`. Then choose `Install` and wait for the installation to finish.
    * Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below. If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
		* Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/openjdk-bin:21`
		* Archlinux: `pacman -S jdk21-openjdk`
		* Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install openjdk-21-jdk`
		* Fedora: `yum install java-1.21.0-openjdk`
2. Open up your command line and run `javac`. If it spews out a bunch of possible options and the usage, you're good to go. If not, try the steps again.

**Troubleshooting**
If the `javac` command does not work on Windows:
* Go to `Control Panel\System and Security\System` and click on `Advanced System Settings` on the left-hand side.
* Click on `Environment Variables`.
* Under `System Variables`, click `New`.
* For `Variable Name`, input `JAVA_HOME`.
* For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45` exactly as shown (or wherever your Java JDK installation is) and click `OK`.
* Scroll down to a variable named `Path` and double-click on it.
* Append `;%JAVA_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `OK`. Make sure the location is correct; double-check to make sure.

#### Setup Gradle (Optional)
Gradle is used to execute the various build tasks when compiling FourTwenty.

1. Download and install Gradle.
	* [Windows/Mac download link](http://www.gradle.org/downloads). You only need the binaries, but choose whatever flavor you want.
		* Unzip the package and put it wherever you want, for example, `C:\Gradle`.
	* Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below. If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.gradle.org/downloads).
		* Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/gradle-bin`
		* Archlinux: You'll have to install it from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gradle).
		* Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install gradle`
		* Fedora: Install Gradle manually from its website (see above), as Fedora ships a "broken" version of Gradle. Use `yum install gradle` only if you know what you're doing.
2. Windows: Set environment variables for Gradle.
	* Go back to `Environment Variables` and then create a new system variable.
	* For `Variable Name`, input `GRADLE_HOME`.
	* For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Gradle-3.0` exactly as shown (or wherever your Gradle installation is), and click `Ok`.
	* Scroll down to `Path` again, and append `;%GRADLE_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `Ok`. Once again, double-check the location.
3. Open up your command line and run `gradle`. If it says 'Welcome to Gradle [version].', then you're good to go. If not, try the steps again.

#### Setup Git
Git is used to clone FourTwenty and update your local copy.

1. Download and install Git [here](http://git-scm.com/download/).
2. *Optional*: Download and install a Git GUI client, such as Gitkraken, SourceTree, GitHub for Windows/Mac, SmartGitHg, TortoiseGit, etc. A nice list is available [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).


##### Troubleshooting
If Gradle synchronization fails, make sure:
1. `File ‚Üí Project structure ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Project SDK` is set to your installed JDK version.
2. `File ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Build, Execution, Deployment ‚Üí Build Tools ‚Üí Gradle ‚Üí Gradle JVM` is set to your installed JDK version.

#### Updating Your Repository
To get the most up-to-date builds, you'll have to update your local repository periodically.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to `basefolder` in the console.
3. Ensure you have not made any changes to the local repository (if you did, there might be issues with Git).
	* If you have, try reverting them to their status when you last updated your repository.
4. Execute `git pull version/1.16.3`. This pulls all commits from the official repository that do not yet exist on your local repository and updates it (with GitKraken, click the small pull arrow at the top).

#### Troubleshooting
- Sometimes Gradle tasks fail because of missing memory. For that, you can find system-wide settings in the `.gradle` folder of your `HOME` directory (`~/.gradle/gradle.properties` or on Windows in `C:\Users\username\.gradle\gradle.properties`).
- Sometimes after a branch change, libraries can not be resolved. Running another refresh in IntelliJ or the command line usually solves this issue.
