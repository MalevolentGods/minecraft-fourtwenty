# FourTwenty üåø

A comprehensive Minecraft mod that adds a cannabis cultivation system to your game. Grow, harvest, and craft cannabis into various consumable products with unique gameplay effects.

## üéÆ Features

### Cannabis Cultivation System
- **Weed Seeds**: Plant these to start your cannabis farm
- **Growing Cycle**: Cannabis plants grow through 8 distinct stages (0-7), just like vanilla crops
- **Weed Crop Block**: A fully functional crop that requires proper farming conditions
- **Harvesting**: Mature plants (stage 7) drop both weed buds and seeds for sustainable farming

### Natural Wild Cannabis
- **Wild Weed Spawning**: Cannabis plants now spawn naturally in the wild across specific biomes
- **Target Biomes**: Plains, Savanna, Grove, and Meadow biomes feature natural cannabis growth
- **Random Growth Stages**: Wild plants spawn at various ages (3-7) for realistic diversity
- **Harvestable Resources**: Wild cannabis can be harvested for seeds and buds, providing an alternative source
- **Balanced Rarity**: Wild plants are uncommon enough to feel special but common enough to find with exploration

### Items & Crafting
- **Weed Bud**: The primary harvest from mature cannabis plants
- **Weed Joint**: Craftable consumable made from weed buds and paper
- **Crafting Recipe**: Create joints using a vertical pattern of Paper ‚Üí Weed Bud ‚Üí Paper

- Loot tables ensure balanced drop rates (buds only from mature crops)
- Recipe system uses standard crafting mechanics
- Effect system uses vanilla potion effects for compatibility

## For Users

### Installation & Usage

1. **Requirements**: Ensure you have Minecraft 1.21.1 with NeoForge 21.1.92+ installed
2. **Download**: Get the latest release from CurseForge (link TBD)
3. **Install**: Place the mod JAR file in your `mods/` folder
4. **Play**: Start Minecraft and look for the "Four Twenty" creative tab

### Getting Started
1. **Obtain Seeds**: Find weed seeds in the Four Twenty creative tab, or harvest them from wild cannabis plants
2. **Find Wild Cannabis**: Explore Plains, Savanna, Grove, and Meadow biomes to discover naturally spawning cannabis
3. **Plant**: Place seeds on tilled farmland (requires water source nearby)
4. **Wait**: Cannabis takes time to grow through 8 stages - be patient!
5. **Harvest**: Break mature crops (stage 7) to get weed buds and seeds - wild plants drop seeds based on their age
6. **Craft**: Use the crafting recipe (Paper-Bud-Paper vertically) to make joints
7. **Consume**: Right-click and hold to smoke a joint and experience the effects

**Pro Tips:**
- Wild cannabis at higher ages (6-7) yield more seeds when harvested
- Look for wild plants in open grassland areas within the target biomes
- Wild cannabis can be a great early-game source of seeds before setting up a farm

### Compiling FourTwenty

IMPORTANT: Please report any issues you have, as there might be some problems with the documentation! Also make sure you know EXACTLY what you're doing! It's not our fault if your OS crashes, becomes corrupted, etc.

#### Setup Java
The Java JDK is used to compile FourTwenty.

1. Download and install the Java JDK 21.
    * [Windows](https://adoptopenjdk.net/): Choose OpenJDK 21 (LTS) version and HotSpot JVM, then click the `latest release` button. After the download is complete, open the file, accept the license agreement, and in a custom setup make sure that `Add to Path` and `Set JAVA_HOME` are set to `Entire feature will be installed on your local hard drive`. Then choose `Install` and wait for the installation to finish.
    * Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below. If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
		* Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/openjdk-bin:21`
		* Archlinux: `pacman -S jdk21-openjdk`
		* Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install openjdk-21-jdk`
		* Fedora: `yum install java-1.21.0-openjdk`
2. Open up your command line and run `javac`. If it spews out a bunch of possible options and the usage, you're good to go. If not, try the steps again.

**Troubleshooting**
If the `javac` command does not work on Windows:
* Go to `Control Panel\System and Security\System` and click on `Advanced System Settings` on the left-hand side.
* Click on `Environment Variables`.
* Under `System Variables`, click `New`.
* For `Variable Name`, input `JAVA_HOME`.
* For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45` exactly as shown (or wherever your Java JDK installation is) and click `OK`.
* Scroll down to a variable named `Path` and double-click on it.
* Append `;%JAVA_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `OK`. Make sure the location is correct; double-check to make sure.

#### Setup Gradle (Optional)
Gradle is used to execute the various build tasks when compiling FourTwenty.

1. Download and install Gradle.
	* [Windows/Mac download link](http://www.gradle.org/downloads). You only need the binaries, but choose whatever flavor you want.
		* Unzip the package and put it wherever you want, for example, `C:\Gradle`.
	* Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below. If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.gradle.org/downloads).
		* Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/gradle-bin`
		* Archlinux: You'll have to install it from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gradle).
		* Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install gradle`
		* Fedora: Install Gradle manually from its website (see above), as Fedora ships a "broken" version of Gradle. Use `yum install gradle` only if you know what you're doing.
2. Windows: Set environment variables for Gradle.
	* Go back to `Environment Variables` and then create a new system variable.
	* For `Variable Name`, input `GRADLE_HOME`.
	* For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Gradle-3.0` exactly as shown (or wherever your Gradle installation is), and click `Ok`.
	* Scroll down to `Path` again, and append `;%GRADLE_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `Ok`. Once again, double-check the location.
3. Open up your command line and run `gradle`. If it says 'Welcome to Gradle [version].', then you're good to go. If not, try the steps again.

#### Setup Git
Git is used to clone FourTwenty and update your local copy.

1. Download and install Git [here](http://git-scm.com/download/).
2. *Optional*: Download and install a Git GUI client, such as Gitkraken, SourceTree, GitHub for Windows/Mac, SmartGitHg, TortoiseGit, etc. A nice list is available [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).


##### Troubleshooting
If Gradle synchronization fails, make sure:
1. `File ‚Üí Project structure ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Project SDK` is set to your installed JDK version.
2. `File ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Build, Execution, Deployment ‚Üí Build Tools ‚Üí Gradle ‚Üí Gradle JVM` is set to your installed JDK version.

#### Updating Your Repository
To get the most up-to-date builds, you'll have to update your local repository periodically.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to `basefolder` in the console.
3. Ensure you have not made any changes to the local repository (if you did, there might be issues with Git).
	* If you have, try reverting them to their status when you last updated your repository.
4. Execute `git pull version/1.16.3`. This pulls all commits from the official repository that do not yet exist on your local repository and updates it (with GitKraken, click the small pull arrow at the top).

#### Troubleshooting
- Sometimes Gradle tasks fail because of missing memory. For that, you can find system-wide settings in the `.gradle` folder of your `HOME` directory (`~/.gradle/gradle.properties` or on Windows in `C:\Users\username\.gradle\gradle.properties`).
- Sometimes after a branch change, libraries can not be resolved. Running another refresh in IntelliJ or the command line usually solves this issue.
